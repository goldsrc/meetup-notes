## TS Generics

Dillon Parfitt (Xebia)

Why?

- Abstract Types
- Re-use types
- Help typescript to describe the type of your code
- Conditional type

## AI in Chrome

Gemini Nano in chrome <--
Consent?
is this part of chromium?
is there a way to polyfill this?
can we use this in v8?
can we seed it?

- privacy
- speed -> no network latency
- cost
- offline

Why not?

- need decent hardware
- less versatile
- worse quality -> comprimise

Use cases

- Generate tex -> window.ai.languageModel
- Summrize
- Language detector
- Translator
- Writer API -> it doesn't work :(
- Rewriter API -> same as above

using promptStreaming you can have a chunk effect

### BEWARE

most of the stuff may never launch

only on chrom dev/canary

22 GB STORAGE 4GB video RAM

### Usage

there is a type package for it

you can use the prompt api to have JSON response

note: retry library `pRetry()` also partial JSON

The future?
